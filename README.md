# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This coursework focuses on developing a deep learning-based approach for brain tumor classification using MRI images. The project utilizes a CNN architecture to analyze MRI scans and differentiate between different types of brain tumors. Transfer learning techniques. The dataset used is the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle.
